Studies say that people nowadays have more free time than ever before. Then why doesn’t it feel that way?
These days, our free time is usually spent watching television, using computers or communicating on our phones.
Images and information are constantly flashing into our brains, so it’s no wonder we don’t feel as if we have really switched off.
To really wind down and help us regain our energy levels, it is important to use our free time wisely.
Think about what you want to achieve in your free time.  Do you want to get fit, get creative or simply relax?
Don’t worry about what you ought to be doing, just think about what will make you feel more content.
